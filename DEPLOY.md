### Step 2: Push Code to GitHub

cd ~/redcross-training-search

# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/redcross-training-search.git

git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

3. Scroll down to **Pages** (in the left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**
5. Under **Branch**, select **main**
6. Leave folder as **/ (root)**
7. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Access Your Site

- Your site will be available at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/redcross-training-search/`
- It may take 2-10 minutes to go live the first time
- Check the Pages settings page for the status

## Alternative: Using GitHub Desktop

## Testing Locally

Before deploying, test locally:

```

Visit: http://localhost:8000

## Updating the Site

After making changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe your changes"
git push
```

GitHub Pages will automatically update within a few minutes.

## Custom Domain (Optional)

To use a custom domain like `training.redcross.org`:

1. In Pages settings, add your custom domain
2. Create a `CNAME` file in the repository root with your domain
3. Configure your DNS:
   - A records: `185.199.108.153`, `185.199.109.153`, `185.199.110.153`, `185.199.111.153`
   - Or CNAME record: `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io`

## Troubleshooting

### Site not loading?

- Ensure repository is public
- Wait 10 minutes for initial deployment
- Check https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/redcross-training-search/actions for build status

### 404 Error?
